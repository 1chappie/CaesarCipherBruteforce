# CaesarCipherBruteforce - CLI based

Using frequency analysis to break Caesarâ€™s cipher. This is a brute force method that tests all the possible displacements and returns the most likely decryption of a text. Frequency analysis relies on the fact that some letters (or combination of letters) occur more in a language, regardless of the text size.
